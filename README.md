# Project
(Object detection using CV tools)similarity-and-dissimilarity-measurement-using-statistical-metrics


The main goal of this project is to develop a computer vision system that could perform
an object (for example, coins, faces, animals, cars, plants) recognition (classification)
task by using at least 5 local and global features (Haralick Texture, Box Counting,
Chain Code, Area, and Local Binary Pattern)
# Project Introduction
This project is about gender detection where 5 male and 5 female images are used for preprocessing
and feature extraction. Finally, the correlation coefficient is used to measure the similarity between
males and females respectively.
